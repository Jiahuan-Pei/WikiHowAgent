# WorldTaskEval
### 1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used to generate responses based on human instructions. 

> Can LLMs be effective in helping humans complete concrete tasks in real-world scenarios?

While several studies have evaluated LLMs' performance on specific tasks, the scope of these evaluations remains limited. In contrast, a vast number of practical tasks exist in the real world. For example, WikiHow contains hundreds of guidelines that teach people how to perform tasks, which cover  a wide variety of human-written tasks ranging from "how to bake a cake" to "how to build a jet." 

The objective of this project is to assess LLMs' ability to assist with real-world task completion.
